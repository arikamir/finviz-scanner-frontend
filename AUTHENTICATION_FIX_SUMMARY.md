## ðŸ”— Backend Integration Ready

The frontend authentication flow is now fully functional. The next step is to:
1. Start the FastAPI backend server
2. Configure proper API endpoints
3. Handle the current 401 Unauthorized errors

**This PR resolves the core authentication UX issue and provides a solid foundation for backend integration.**
