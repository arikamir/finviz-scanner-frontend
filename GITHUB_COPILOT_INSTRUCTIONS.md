# GitHub Copilot Development Instructions - Frontend Repository

This document outlines the development workflow and guidelines for the **Finviz Scanner Frontend** project when working with GitHub Copilot.

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

This is the **frontend repository** containing:
- `frontend.html` - Main web application interface
- `auth-test.html` - Authentication testing page
- Docker configuration files
- Deployment scripts and SSL setup
- Documentation and setup guides

**Note**: The backend Python package has its own separate repository at [finviz-scanner](https://github.com/arikamir/finviz-scanner)

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

**All feature development MUST follow this branching strategy:**

1. **Main Branch Protection**: The `main` branch is protected and requires pull requests
2. **Feature Branches**: All new features, bug fixes, and improvements must be developed on feature branches
3. **Branch Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names following this pattern:
   - `feature/description` - for new features
   - `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
   - `enhancement/description` - for improvements
   - `docs/description` - for documentation updates
   - `deploy/description` - for deployment-related changes
   - `auth/description` - for authentication-related changes

### Required Workflow Steps

#### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Examples:
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode
git checkout -b feature/improve-mobile-ui
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-auth-redirect
git checkout -b enhancement/optimize-loading
git checkout -b auth/add-multi-factor-auth
git checkout -b deploy/add-kubernetes-config
```

#### 2. Development with GitHub Copilot
- Use GitHub Copilot to assist with frontend code generation
- Follow modern web development standards and patterns
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility
- Test across different browsers and devices

#### 3. Local Testing Before Push
```bash
# Test the frontend locally
open frontend.html

# Test authentication
open auth-test.html

# If using Docker, test the full stack
docker-compose up -d

# Test SSL configuration (if applicable)
# Check deployment scripts
./deployment/docker-build.sh
```

#### 4. Commit and Push Feature Branch
```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message following conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle to frontend

- Implement dark/light theme switcher
- Update CSS variables for theme support
- Add user preference persistence
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Test across all supported browsers"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 5. Create Pull Request
- Navigate to GitHub repository: https://github.com/arikamir/finviz-scanner-frontend (to be created)
- Create pull request from feature branch to `main`
- Use the pull request template (see below)

- Provide clear user feedback for auth states

## üö´ Prohibited Actions

**The following actions are NOT allowed:**

1. **‚ùå Direct commits to main branch**
2. **‚ùå Force pushing to main branch**
3. **‚ùå Merging pull requests without passing all checks**
4. **‚ùå Bypassing code review requirements**
5. **‚ùå Accepting Copilot suggestions without review**
6. **‚ùå Committing sensitive data (API keys, tokens, etc.)**
7. **‚ùå Breaking authentication security measures**

## üîß Automated Checks Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow (to be implemented)

The repository should include automated checks that run on every pull request:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml (example)
name: Frontend CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  frontend-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js (if using build tools)
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Validate HTML
        run: |
          # HTML validation
          curl -H "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8" \
               --data-binary @frontend.html \
               https://validator.w3.org/nu/?out=gnu
      
      - name: Test Docker Build
        run: |
          docker build --target production -t finviz-frontend .
          docker run --rm finviz-frontend
      
      - name: Test Docker Compose
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml config
      
      - name: Security Scan
        run: |
          # Scan for sensitive data in commits
          git log --oneline | head -10

  deployment-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Test Deployment Scripts
        run: |
          chmod +x deployment/*.sh
          # Test script syntax
          bash -n deployment/docker-build.sh
          bash -n deployment/docker-manage.sh
```
