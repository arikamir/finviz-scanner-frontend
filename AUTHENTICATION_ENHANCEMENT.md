# Authentication Flow Enhancement

## Problem Fixed
- Users had to click "Analyze Stocks" twice when not authenticated
- Pending requests were not persisting properly

## Solution Applied
Enhanced the authentication flow with:

1. **SessionStorage Integration**: Pending requests now persist in sessionStorage for reliability
2. **Dual Storage Check**: System checks both global variables and sessionStorage for pending requests  
3. **Enhanced Auto-Execution**: After authentication, the system automatically executes any pending analysis requests

## Key Changes Made
- Updated `setPendingRequest()` to store in both global variable and sessionStorage
- Enhanced `clearPendingRequest()` to clear both storage locations
- Modified `handleCredentialResponse()` to check sessionStorage for pending requests
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

## User Experience Improvement
- Single-click authentication flow
- Automatic execution after authentication
- No lost analysis requests during authentication process

## Security Features Maintained
- 5-minute timeout for pending requests
- SessionStorage clears on tab close
- Proper cleanup mechanisms
